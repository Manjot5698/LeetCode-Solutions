# 🚀 LeetCode Solutions in Java

![LeetCode Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/LeetCode-✔%20Solved-orange?style=for-the-badge&logo=LeetCode)

Welcome to **LeetCode‑Solutions**, my dedicated space to master Data Structures and Algorithms in Java. I commit to solving **2–3 problems daily**, emphasizing deep understanding, clean code, and meaningful comments.
